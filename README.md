## Description
Suspicious that your friend is overexaggerating an NBA player's stats? Ask this NBA voice assistant for the player's stats from any season!
My inspiration for this came from Tech With Tim's Python Voice Assistant tutorial on YouTube. His tutorial was focused on using the Google Calendar API but I wanted to use the NBA API.

## Potential updates
NBA API has many more capabilities, including shot charts and team data
Better stats can also be pulled such as True Shooting % or per possession stats
Speech recognition is quite iffy
